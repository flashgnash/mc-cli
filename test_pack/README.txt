This .zip is for SERVER USAGE ONLY

-
How to install the custom Origins:
Starting from the non-server download of Infernal RPG, find the folder called "global_data_packs".
From there, take the file inside called "InfernalOriginsHARDFIX.zip" and move that to your server world's datapack folder.
After that, restart your server, and you should now only see the new Origin choices.
If you have launched the server beforehand and joined it, you'll need to spawn in an Orb of Origin to reselect your Origin as the newer ones.

-
How to install the enchantment config:
Same instructions as before, but we'll be finding the folder called "defaultconfigs".
Inside, you'll find a file named "ensorcellation-server.toml", take this file and move it to your server world's serverconfig folder.
After that, as usual make sure to restart your server if it's already launched.
